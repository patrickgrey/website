    Saunders was obsessed with documenting how the new global
    counterculture was changing the ancient city around him. In 1970, at
    the age of 32, he self-published his findings in a slim but dense
    guidebook called Alternative London. The book was testament to
    Saundersâ€™ belief that information should be made available to all, and
    that this information should be rigorously tested.

    This explains WebC nicely for me! Zach notes the problem where if you
    add HTML inside the web component, either light or shadow DOM, you end
    up repeating all of that templating each time you use it. The solution
    is to have one template that can be reused by multiple custom
    elements. Under WCAG disucssion. WebC treats web compontents as first
    party SSR rendering.
