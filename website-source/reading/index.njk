    <h2>Improve my accessibility skills</h2>
    
    <h2>Improve my CSS</h2>
    
    <p>CSS is high on my list as it seems to be evolving faster than the Pokemon my kids are obsessed with. There
        are many features I'm aware of but don't understand (same with Pokemon). CSS to do list:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>3</li>
        <li>4</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Web components</h2>
    
    <p>

            the Light DOM by Eric Baily</a> clicked with me so Web Components are added
        to the list.</p>

I found this video really helpful on a personal level as I've never worked in a 'studio' before so it brought me confidence when I saw that I do a lot of similar things - I also learned a lot and can see plenty where I need to improve.
