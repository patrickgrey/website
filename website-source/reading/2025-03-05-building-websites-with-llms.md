notes: Using just HTML links and CSS page transitions to replace intra page
  interactions. Looks very good for list filtering. My heart wants to go all in
  on this but requiring Javascript (JS) to return to your previous location
  doesn't sit well with me. Progressively enhanced JS interactions in page give
  you an option if JS is broken. This approach breaks if JS breaks. Clicking the
  close button on navigation if JS is broken, for example, takes you back to the
  home page, not the page you were.
