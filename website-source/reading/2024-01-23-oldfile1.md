  Saunders was obsessed with documenting how the new global counterculture was changing the ancient city around him. In 1970, at the age of 32, he self-published his findings in a slim but dense guidebook called Alternative London. The book was testament to Saundersâ€™ belief that information should be made available to all, and that this information should be rigorously tested.
