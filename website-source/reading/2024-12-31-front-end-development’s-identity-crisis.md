notes: 'Elly does a great job of outlining the difficulties in answering the job
  title question, "What do I call myself"? The question helps to illustrate some
  of the problems endemic in the tech industry today. I think this article came
  out when more and more people were starting realise the issues that React was
  creating. Since then, I think the movement has only got stronger. The article
  ends on why "Web designer" is a good title. '
