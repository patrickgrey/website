notes: "\"...only few professional software engineers can “afford” to have the
  second option [simple HTML and CSS sites] as their personal website, and
  almost all normal users are stuck with overcomplicated solutions\". Great
  point also about lawyer and accountant domains gatekeeping with uneccessary
  complexity. ALSO, the web is more interesting when it's accessible to those
  who are NOT web devs."
