  Good advice on URL design. I would like to change mine but I feel stuck with
  it as posts are published. Must look into redirects...


  I added the date to my posts, not as subfolders but in the title. I like seeing dates on things to know how contemporary it is. However, I think this has made my posts too long and the dates will appear in the articles anyway. I might shorten my filenames instead of just copying the full title too.
