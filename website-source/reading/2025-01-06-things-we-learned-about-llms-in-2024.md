notes: "This is an expert and fair review of the LLM domain to date. It notes
  the advances and cautions about consequences. As noted, they are getting more
  efficient but data centres continue to be built with massive environmental
  impact. Despite the efficiencies, I suspect this will be like widening
  motorways: adding more lanes encourages more traffic. I think the main problem
  will remain something that wasn't mentioned here. The organisations behind
  this tech are mostly bad actor acolyte's of unfettered capitlaism. Profit
  without regard to humans. We've seen this before. That and missing Government
  regulation.  And here is where the big profit is:

  drones-faculty-ai-artificial-intelligence. The only regulation the UK
  government has proposed so far is to excuse LLMs from copyright law."
