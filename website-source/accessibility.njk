<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I didn't know how to use NVDA properly in order to test this site. For example, when I started tabbing, I'd miss out large parts of text or I didn't know how to skip the tag lists in each card (which quickly became annoying). Would I need to provide a skip or can users do this if properly announced?</p>
