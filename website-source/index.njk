      <h1>Hello!</h1>  

      <p>Welcome to my little corner of the web. Come in, make yourself at home.</p>

      <p>I'm <strong>Patrick Grey</strong>. I'm a front-end developer living in the Mid&#8209;Argyll area of Scotland. I have a web development business called <a href="https://risingsky.co.uk" target="_blank">Rising Sky</a>. Take a look, maybe I can help you on your next project!</p>

      <p>This is the place where I infrequently write about stuff. Often coding stuff. I like to keep a note of the latest things I've read / listened to / watched on my <a href="/reading/">reading list</a>.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="https://glasgow.social/@patrick" target="_blank">find me on Mastodon</a>. Feel free to say hi, I really enjoy talking to all sorts of people, especially nerds.</p>

      <p>I'm continually developing this site in the wild so hold onto your hat! (insert under construction gif here)</p>
