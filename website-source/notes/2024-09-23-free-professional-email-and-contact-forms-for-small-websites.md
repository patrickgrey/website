It's always nice to have a professional email associated with your website. It's an added bonus to have a contact form that can send messages to that email address.

I found a couple of free options that work really well if you expect low levels of contact for the project.

[Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html) offers a free plan that gives good instructions on getting set up. Go to the pricing page and scroll down for the free offer.

[web3forms](https://web3forms.com/) offers an incredibly easy and free way to set up a contact form. It also allows a progressive enhacement option to call via fetch: <https://docs.web3forms.com/how-to-guides/html-and-javascript>.
