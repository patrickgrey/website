This allows you to efficiently\ninsert images, markdown, html and embeds.\n\nFor Example:\n\n * Insert a video from YouTube directly into your content by pasting the URL \n * Create unique content like a button or content opt-in using the HTML card\n * Need to share some code? Embed code blocks directly \n\n<header class=\"site-header outer\">\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n        {{> \"site-nav\"}}\n    </div>\n</header>\n\nWorking with images in posts\nYou can add images to your posts in many ways:\n\n * Upload from your computer\n * Click and drag an image into the browser\n * Paste directly into the editor from your clipboard\n * Insert using a URL\n\nOnce inserted you can blend images beautifully into your content at different\nsizes and add captions wherever needed.\n\nThe post settings menu and publishing options can be found in the top right hand\ncorner.
